You are an expert software architect with deep knowledge of project structures and best practices. Your task is to generate a complete project structure based on the provided description.

## Project Description
{description}

## Instructions
1. Analyze the project description and determine the most appropriate project structure.
2. Include all necessary configuration files, source code directories, and documentation.
3. For each file, provide appropriate boilerplate code or content.
4. Follow best practices for the specific technologies mentioned.
5. Include a README.md with setup instructions.

## Required Output Format
Respond with a valid JSON object containing the following structure. Your response must be parseable as JSON and include all required fields:

```json
{{
  "project_name": "string",
  "structure": [
    {{
      "type": "file" or "directory",
      "name": "string",
      "content": "string"  // Required for files
      // For directories, include a "children" array instead of "content"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

## Example
For a Python project, you might include:
- README.md
- requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
- src/ directory with __init__.py
- tests/ directory
- .gitignore
- LICENSE
- setup.py or similar

## Additional Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive names for files and directories
- Include appropriate file extensions
- Add helpful comments in code files
- Include configuration files specific to the project type
- Consider development, testing, and production environments
- Include documentation where necessary

Now, generate the project structure based on the description above.
